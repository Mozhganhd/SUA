# Surplus Unit Allocation Optimization

## Project Overview
This project addresses a **stochastic surplus allocation optimization problem** provided by Corteva Agriscience. The task is to determine optimal surplus units to add to demand forecasts of agricultural products in order to **maximize total expected profit**, while respecting:

1. Product-level **capacity limits**
2. A global ("macro") cap on total surplus (e.g., 20%-50% of total demand)
3. Group-level **substitutability constraints**, ensuring sufficient surplus coverage within each group

I implemented and compared multiple optimization strategies to explore trade-offs between convergence, interpretability, and constraint satisfaction.

## üìä Problem Definition

### Variables and Parameters
- `n`: Number of products  
- `x_i`: Surplus units added to product `i` (decision variable)  
- `D_i`: Forecasted demand for product `i`  
- `M_i`: Margin per unit (net price - COGS) for product `i`  
- `C_i`: Maximum surplus capacity for product `i`  
- `G_k`: Set of products belonging to substitutability group `k`  
- `alpha`: Macro surplus limit fraction (e.g., 0.2 for 20%)  
- `O_i = max(E[~D_i] - D_i, 0)`: Overflow demand, where `~D_i` is simulated from Burr distribution

### Objective
**Maximize total expected profit:**

```text
maximize:    sum_i [ M_i * min(x_i, O_i) ]
```

### Subject to

**Capacity Constraint (per product):**
```text
0 <= x_i <= C_i    for all i
```

**Macro Surplus Cap:**
```text
sum_i x_i <= alpha * sum_i D_i
```

**Substitutability Group Coverage:**
```text
sum_{i in G_k} x_i >= beta * sum_{i in G_k} O_i    for all groups k
```

## Optimization Strategies and Evolution

### 1. `SLSQP_nogroupconstraint.py`
- **Approach**: Started with a baseline SLSQP optimization without group-level constraints.
- **Constraints**: Applied only capacity and macro-level surplus limit.
- **Outcome**: The model converged and provided a reference for expected profit under basic feasibility.

### 2. `SLSQP_hardConstraint.py`
- **Approach**: Added strict hard constraints to ensure each substitutability group receives at least as much surplus as its expected overflow.
- **Constraint Logic**:
    - For each group: `sum(surplus in group) >= sum(expected overflow in group)`
- **Outcome**: Optimization often failed to converge, returning `Exit mode 8: Positive directional derivative for linesearch`.
- **Observation**: Likely due to overly strict or infeasible constraints across large product sets. Optimization slowed down significantly.

### 3. `SLSQP_penaltyConstraints.py`
- **Approach**: Replaced hard constraints with penalty terms added to the objective for each group under-supplied.
- **Penalty Term**: `penalty += (group_need - group_surplus)^2` when surplus < overflow.
- **Outcome**: Improved convergence on small-scale tests (first 100 products). Scaling to the full dataset again caused convergence issues and slow down the speed.

### 4. `SLSQP_softConstraints.py`
- **Approach**: Applied a relaxed constraint strategy where groups must receive only a fraction (e.g., 30%) of their overflow.
- **Outcome**: A compromise between feasibility and constraint satisfaction. Some constraint violation still occurred, but it converged more reliably than the hard-constraint version.

### 5. `PSO.py` (Particle Swarm Optimization)
- **Approach**: Used `pyswarms` for global optimization with penalty-based constraints.
- **Advantages**: No reliance on gradient information; can escape local optima.
- **Outcome**: Convergence achieved, and profit improved. However, **some groups still showed a surplus < overflow**, resulting in unmet expected demand.

### 6. `L-BFGS-B_penalty.py`
- **Approach**: Used L-BFGS-B optimizer with capacity and macro limits as bounds, and added penalty terms to the objective for group constraint violations.
- **Observation**: Faster than SLSQP in some tests. Yet, as with PSO, some substitutability groups still experienced positive gaps(surplus < overflow).

---

## Important Concepts
- **Overflow**: For each product, overflow = max(mean(simulated demand) - demand, 0). It estimates the extra units potentially needed to satisfy stochastic demand.
- **Group Gap**: For each group: `gap = total group overflow - total group surplus`. Positive values indicate unmet expected demand in the group.

## üìÅ Code Overview

All source code is located in the `src/` directory. Each script implements a different optimization strategy:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SLSQP_nogroupconstraint.py` | Baseline using SLSQP with capacity and macro-level surplus constraints only. No group-level constraints. |
| `SLSQP_hardConstraint.py` | Adds **hard constraints** ensuring each substitutability group receives surplus at least equal to its overflow. May face convergence issues. |
| `SLSQP_penaltyConstraints.py` | Uses **penalty terms** instead of hard constraints for group coverage. Better convergence but allows some violation. |
| `SLSQP_SoftConstraints.py` | Relaxes group constraint to a fractional coverage (e.g., 30% of overflow), balancing feasibility and accuracy. |
| `L-BFGS-B_penalty.py` | Gradient-based optimizer (L-BFGS-B) with capacity bounds and penalty terms for group constraint violations. |
| `PSO.py` | Applies **Particle Swarm Optimization** (`pyswarms`) with penalty-based constraint handling. Suitable for non-convex search spaces. |

Each script outputs results to its own folder under `results/`, including:
- `optimal_surplus_output.csv`: Final surplus allocation
- `profit_distribution.png`: Histogram of simulated profit outcomes
- `surplus_per_product.png`: Surplus assigned per product
  
---

## Final Notes
- **Hard vs Soft Constraints**: Hard constraints provide guarantees but may become infeasible under tight limits. Penalty methods offer flexibility but may not fully meet group-level goals.
- **Scalability**: Applying strict group constraints to 500+ products is challenging. Relaxed or penalty-based methods improve scalability.
- **PSO & L-BFGS-B**: Both offer valuable global or smooth convergence but need fine-tuned penalties to respect all constraints.
